# Benefits and The Revision Process

## Revision Process

Any changes to this document must be applied through GitHub pull requests.
Each pull request must be approved by Sam and the president of Computerization to be merged into
master.
To maintain a clean commit history, it should be merged into master by 'squash and merge'.
This policy should be strictly enforced by GitHub’s branch protection feature.
Commits in the pull request must be signed (having a green Verified badge in commit page) and its
author must have GitHub 2-factor authentication enabled to have legal effect.

Once this agreement is finalized, Sam does not have the right to unilaterally end the sponsorship,
unless under extreme circumstances. However, Computerization has the right to end this sponsorship
at any time and Sam has the ultimate right to interpret this document in any reasonable way.

This agreement must be manually renewed each year, while Sam is not at work.

## Benefits List

Note:

- All benefits in this section should be considered independently.
- The funds are not available during Sam’s internship. As mitigation, more funds will be provided
  prior to Sam’s internship.

### General Responsibilities

Sam must be informed about how these funds are being used. To avoid abuse of the fund of club
leaders, every member should be informed about the existence of this sponsorship, and members have
the right to question the usage of the fund and ways to anonymously report to Sam about concerns
without concerns of retaliation.

There will likely be unused budgets at the end of the academic year. The remaining money must be
securely transferred to the next Computerization leader.

### Blanket Fund

As long as Computerization follows the basic terms, it will receive $200 with no other conditions
attached.

### Prioritized Referrals

Sam will try to offer tech company referral opportunities to all Computerization members with high
priority. However, members are not guaranteed this opportunity. Sam will try to assess resumes of
members to give feedback. However, feedback is not guaranteed to help you improve your chances of
entering any tech company since Sam is not an expert on this matter.

Unlike other benefits, this benefit is always active and will remain active in the foreseeable
future.

### Technical Consulting

Feel free to ask Sam about technical decisions while he is not doing his internship. Sam is
committed to answer any questions at least once a week. However, it's not guaranteed that Sam's
advice will be applicable to Computerization.

### Personal Website Cost Reimbursement

All members of Computerization, past or present, will receive full reimbursement of their personal
websites cost until the end of their college freshmen year, given that the following requirements
are satisfied:

1. The personal website must be open sourced on GitHub with one of the licenses listed on the
   [Choose A License website](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/).
2. The personal website must be relatively complete. For example, a website that only contains
   'Hello world!' is not considered as complete.
3. The personal website backend must not run crazily expensive computations
   (e.g. mining cryptocurrencies).
4. The personal website must be deployed on machines with reasonable hardware capacity. For
   example, a single-page static website deployed to 96-core CPU, 1TB memory and 256TB SSD will not
   be considered as reasonable.

### Development/Deployment Cost Reimbursement

All allowed items in [`APPROVED_REIMBURSEMENT_LIST.md`](./APPROVED_REIMBURSEMENT_LIST.md) will be
fully reimbursed. However, Computerization members must make some faithful attempt to minimize the
cost.
